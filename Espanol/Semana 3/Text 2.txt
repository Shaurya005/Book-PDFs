This is my family. Well, part of the family: my mother's family,
my mom's. This is my mother, Ana, and this is my father, José.
These are my grand-parents: Isabel and Mauricio.
We are in the garden of their house. Here are my uncles: Pedro and Claudio,
and these are their wives, my aunts.
Here is my husband and this is my brother Javier.
This is his wife: my sister-in-law Amparo. And here in the middle
is my little sister, Verónica.
