Hello and welcome. Coming up next we are going to see the posessives:
For the form yo, the posessives are: mi in singular, mis in plural.
Posessives match only in number with the object.
For the form tú we have the posessives tu in singular, tus in
plural. As in the example: your (singular) city or your (plural) friends.
Finally, for the form él/ella we have su (singular)
and sus (plural). Su (singular) padre may mean Carlos's father
or Ana's father. Sus hermanas(in plural)
may mean Carlos's sisters or Ana's sisters.
