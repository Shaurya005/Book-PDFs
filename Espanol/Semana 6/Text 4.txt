Careful! We are many spanish-speaking countries and not all of us use
the same words. For example,
we use acá (here) and allá (there) in Hispanic America,
and we use aquí (here) and allí (there) in Spain.
When we are near, in Hispanic America we say acá
and when we are far, we say allá.
In Spain, when we are far we say allí
and when we are near we say aquí.
