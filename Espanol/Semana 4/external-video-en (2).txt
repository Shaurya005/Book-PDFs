Hello, how are you? We are going to see the indefinite article. In Spanish,
the indefinite article has gender and number. That is,
feminine and masculine, singular and plural.
When the noun is masculine and singular, we have to use
the word "un" (a/an). For example, I normally have a coffee in the morning.
When the noun is masculine and plural, we use the word
"unos" (some). For example, on sundays I on excursions with some friends.
When the noun is feminine and singular, we have to use
"una" (a/an). For example, it's very healthy to have an orange for breakfast.
And, finally, when the noun is feminine and plural, we have
to use the word "unas" (some). For example, there are some apples
in the kitchen.
