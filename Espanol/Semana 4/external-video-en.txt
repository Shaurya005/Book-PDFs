Hello, how are you? We are now going to talk about the definite article.
In Spanish, the definite article has gender
and number, that is to say, we distinguish between feminine and masculine,
singular and plural. When the noun is masculine and singular,
we have to use the word "el" (the). For example, Marta's boyfriend
is fair-haired. The boyfriend. When the noun is masculine and plural,
we have to use "los" (the), the word "los". For example, the couches
in my living-room are black. The couches.
When the noun is feminine and singular, we have to use "la" (the)
the word "la". The kitchen in my house is modern and large. The kitchen.
And when the noun is feminine and pluralistic we haveto use
"las" (the). For example, I like vegetables a lot.
