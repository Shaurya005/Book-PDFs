Hello, how are you? We are going to talk about the verb 'ser'.
We use 'ser' to identify. When we want to identify
something, we use 'ser', to be. This is a clock.
We also use 'ser' to describe somebody's profession,
to describe a relationship... things that are more or less permanent
during the moment we are speaking.
