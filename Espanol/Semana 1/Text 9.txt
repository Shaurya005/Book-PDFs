Hola, ¿qué tal? Vamos a hablar de la letra h, una letra pero ningún
sonido. We're going to talk about the letter h which isn't pronounced
in Spanish. Now, let's see some examples:
We have Elena and Helena, written with H and without
H and they're pronounced exactly the same: (H)Elena.
Another example: hospital -hospital-, hospital.
Hotel -hotel-, hotel; hijos -children, sons and daughters-, hijos.
OK, so try to remember this... that H is never pronounced
in Spanish. OK, bye bye.
