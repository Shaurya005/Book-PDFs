Hola, ¿qué tal? Vamos a hablar de las vocales. We're going to talk about
the vowel sounds. There are five vowel sounds in Spanish: a, e, i, o, u.
Do you know how many vowel sounds there are in English, for example? There are twelve!
So that means that it's far easier to pronounce Spanish... at least the vowel sounds! Let's have a look at some examples:
"a" as in azul -blue, the colour blue-; "e", estrella (star)
"i", isla -island-; "o", ojo (eye)
"u", uva (grapes), ok? And now I want you to practise. OK, bye bye.
