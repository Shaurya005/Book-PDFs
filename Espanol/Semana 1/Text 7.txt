Hola, ¿qué tal? Vamos a hablar de dos letras, la letra ge y
la letra jota, y dos sonidos, el sonido y el sonido x/, y las
formas de escribir estos sonidos. We're going to talk about
two letters: G and J. How to pronounce the sounds and x/
and how to write them. Let's have a look at some examples.
If we want to pronounce /x/, we have to use the j with a
as in jardín -garden-, jardín. J and e or g and e
to pronounce the sound [xe]: jersey -jumper-, gente -people-.
The j and the i or a g and an i to pronounce the sound
 [xi]. For example: jirafa -giraffe-, gimnasio -gym-.
We use the letter j and the vowel o to pronounce [xo]
as in joyas -jewelry-, and j and u to pronounce [xu], justicia
-justice-. Now, the use of the j or the g depends on the origin
of the word, ok? We're not going to go into that now, but so that you know.
Now, let's see... to pronounce the sound /g/, we use this combination
of letters: g-a, [ga], as in gato -cat-.
Gue and gui, ok? As you can see, we have a u in the middle there
which isn't pronounced: guerra -war-; "gue" as in guerra.
"Gui" as in guitarra -guitar-. And then the sound g-o,
the sound [go], g-o, gorra -cap-
[gu] guantes, ok? However, if we want to pronounce the u
we have to use the umlaut with the vowels e and i.
For example, bilingüe -bilingual- bilingüe, pingüino -penguin-
pingüino. But we don't use the umlaut with the a or the o. For example,
agua -water-, antiguo -old, antique-.
Now I want you to practise. Here you have the pictures of the words that we have just
spoken about and I want you to practise pronouncing each of these sounds.
OK? OK, then. Bye bye.
