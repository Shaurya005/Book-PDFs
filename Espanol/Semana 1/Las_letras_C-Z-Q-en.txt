Hola, ¿qué tal? Vamos a hablar de tres letras: la c, la z y la q
pero dos sonidos: el sonido y el sonido 0/.
We're going to talk about 3 letters: c, z and q to pronounce 2 sounds
 and 0/. Let's have a look at some examples.
Here we have "ca" as in casa -house-.
"Que", queso -cheese-. "Qui", química -chemistry-. "Co", coche -car-. "Cu", cuchillo
 -knife-, ok? Ca, que, qui, co, cu. But, in order to pronounce
"que" and "qui", we have to use the q and the u, but the u
isn't pronounced here, ok? "Que", "qui". However, with the a,
the o, and the u, we use the c. "Ca, "co", "cu". Now let's see
examples for the sound /0/. For example, zapato -shoe-;
cereza -cherry-, cereza; cine -cinema-, cine; zorro -fox-; zumo -juice-.
OK? And here again with the e and the i we have
a special situation. To write... eh, to pronounce "ce" and "ci" we have
to write this with the c. But to pronounce "za", "zo", "zu", we write it with a
z, ok? Now, you also have to bear in mind that in some regions
in Spain and in most Spanish-speaking countries in America
they pronounce these words with an s sound. Instead of /0/, with the
sound /s/, ok? So instead of saying, for example, "zapato", as I would say
they'll say "sapato", ok? So, "sa", "se", "si", "so", "su".
Instead of "cereza", "seresa", ok? "Sine", "sorro", ok? So bear
this in mind because you'll hear both types of pronunciations. OK, and now
I want you to practise and try to say all of these words
that we've seen in the two previous slides, ok? And practise the sounds
 and 0/ in Spanish. Ok, bye bye.
