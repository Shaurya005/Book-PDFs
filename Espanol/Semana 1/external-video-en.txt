Hello, now i'd like to talk to you about a number of
expressions that we think might come in handy when you visit
spain or any other spanish-speaking country.
Okay so let's start the first one is a greeting
and to say what our name is so in spanish we will say
¡Hola! Me llamo Ana.
Me llamo Ana.
The second expression is ¿Puede ayudarme, por favor?
now imagine that you're in a tricky situation and that you
need to ask somebody for help this is what we would
say ¿Puede ayudarme, por favor? the verb "ayudar"
means to help and "por favor" as you know means
please. So we could say ¿Puede ayudarme,
por favor?
The next one that we've selected is Me he perdido
now when do we do we say this, we say this
in case we get lost in a street or somewhere and we need to
ask somebody to tell us how to get to a particular place, we
would say "Me he perdido", "me he perdido" i'm lost. Ok?
Now we may be in a situation where we need to ask where the
toilet is so what would we say we say ¿Dónde esta
el baño? ¿dónde esta el baño? we can add at the
end of the word "por favor" - please. ¿Dónde esta
el baño? por favor. ok and then they indicate where the toilet is.
Now if we want to find out what the price
of a particular item is we'd say ¿cuánto vale
 esto? ¿cuánto vale esto? Now remember that in spanish
bees and viz a sound exactly the same so
we would say ¿Cuánto vale esto? how much is this.
Ok and finally we selected this word which might come in handy
when you're with friends and when you want to toast to somebody
or something, in spain we say ¡Salud! to your good health
¡Salud! cheers ¡Salud! ok welcome onboard bye bye.
