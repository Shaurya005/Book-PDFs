Hola, ¿qué tal? Vamos a hablar de dos letras, la letra b y la
letra v, pero un sonido, el sonido "b". We're going to talk about
two letters, b and v, but only one sound, the sound "b"
because in Spanish there is no difference between the pronunciation
of the b and the v. We call the letters "be" and "uve". But in some
in some Spanish speaking countries they say "be alta", for the b, "ve baja", for the v.
Let's have a look at some examples.
Bebé,
-baby-. Bebé. Biberón -feeding bottle-. Biberón. Vaso -glass-. Vino
-wine-. Bicicleta -bicycle-. Viento -wind-. You can see
that there's no difference in pronunciation: bebé, vaso, biberón, vino.
OK? Now, I want you to practise. Look at these pictures and
try pronouncing the names of each of these objects. OK? Right.
See you soon. Bye bye.
