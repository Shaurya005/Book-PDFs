Hola, ¿qué tal? Vamos a hablar de dos letras que juntas forman
un sonido, el sonido /ch/. We're going to talk about two letters that make up
one sound, the sound /ch/. Let's see some examples. Let's see...
the word chachachá... do you remember the dance, chachachá?
Leche -milk-, leche; China -China-, China;
ocho, number eight, ocho; and churro... churro. This is a typical
fried dough that you traditionally dip in hot chocolate. And it's delicious! Churro.
OK. Now you try practising these sounds. OK? OK, see you soon. Bye bye.
