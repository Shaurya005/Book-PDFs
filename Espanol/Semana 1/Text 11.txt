Hola, ¿qué tal? Vamos a hablar de una letra pero dos sonidos.
La letra r. Y la r suave y la r fuerte. We're going to talk about the r
which has two different pronunciations: the strong r and the
soft r. Let's have a look at some examples.
Every time we have an r at the beginning of a word, for example
rosa -rose-, río -river-, it's a strong r, ok? Rosa, río. Every time we
have an r after an n or an l, that r
is also strong, ok? Enrique, the name of the man. Enrique. Alrededor.
Around, surrounding. Alrededor. The same goes for the double r
in between vowels. Perro, uhm?, the strong r. Perro -dog-. Carro
-car-, ok? Now, let's see the soft r. Pedro, uhm?, Pedro, the name of
the boy. Árbol -tree-. Here it's a very soft r. Cara -face-. Cara. Pera
-pear-, ok? Now, let's try with these tongue twisters. I'm not sure that I can
get these right myself, but anyway, we're going to try, ok? And afterwards
I want you to practise. Let's see... Erre con erre, guitarra. Erre con
erre, carril. Rápido ruedan los carros, rápido el ferrocarril.
OK, now it's yout turn to try. Bye bye.
