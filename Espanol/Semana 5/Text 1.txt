Hello, I'm Ver√≥nica and I'm going to show you my house.
This is the dinning room,
we have dinner at the table when our friends come,
and at the end there is the couch where I rest.
Now comes the kitchen.
It is very wide and has a table where you can have a nice breakfast
Here is my bedroom,
it has a very nice balcony.
This house has a very beautiful floor,
it has many colours.
And finally,
the bathroom. Goodbye.
