Need for buddy in different cirumstances:-

1. While booking an ola or uber ride.
2. While ordering anything which is having offer on buying 2 or 3 at the same time.
3. While going for a theatre movie, you may enjoy extra with any of your known friends.
4. While going for any live show (standup comedy, singing concert, poetic shows, etc).
5. While going for attending any seminar/workshop/training.
6. While buying any expensive course on Udemy, Codingblocks, etc.

I've seen some of my folks sharing link of some courses/workshops to see if any of batchmate is interested so that they can continue that together.
I've seen my friends asking each other if they wish to have domino's pizza for the offer that are available for buying 2 nos.
Many friends also asked if I'm interested in watching the particular movie at theatres so that they can go together in group and enjoy more.
I have wondered at railway station if anyone is going towards my college and interested in booking ola so that we can do one ola and split the cost.
I have even wondered if anyone else is interested in buying certain thing on flipkart/Amazon which I was about to buy, so that I can avail offer in buying two quantities.
